						<h2>VPN Protocols</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Point-To-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)</li>
							<li>Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP/IPsec)</li>
							<li>Internet Key Exchange, Version 2 (IKEv2)</li>
							<li>OpenVPN</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							This is one of the oldest protocols in use, originally designed by Microsoft. Pros: works on old computers, is a part of the Windows operating system, and it’s easy to set up. Cons: by today’s standards, it’s barely secure. Avoid a provider if this is the only protocol offered.
							L2TP/IPsec (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol). This is a combination of PPTP and Cisco’s L2F protocol. The concept of this protocol is sound — it uses keys to establish a secure connection on each end of your data tunnel — but the execution isn’t very safe. The addition of the IPsec protocol improves security a bit, but there are reports of NSA’s alleged ability to break this protocol and see what’s being transmitted. No matter if those are actually true, the fact that there’s a debate at all is perhaps enough to avoid this as well.
							IKEv2 (Internet Key Exchange, Version 2). This is yet another Microsoft-built protocol. It’s an iteration of Microsoft’s previous protocols and a much more secure one at that. It provides you with some of the best security.
							OpenVPN. This takes what’s best in the above protocols and does away with most of the flaws. It’s based on SSL/TLS and it’s an open source project, which means that it’s constantly being improved by hundreds of developers. It secures the connection by using keys that are known only by the two participating parties on either end of the transmission. Overall, it’s the most versatile and secure protocol out there.

							Unfortunately, not all devices will allow you to use all these protocols. Since most of them were built by Microsoft, you’ll be able to use them on all Windows PCs. For Apple devices, you will come across some limitations. For example, L2TP/IPsec is the default protocol for iPhone.

						## China VPN History

						[2000- Golden Shield Project introduced](https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/great-firewall-of-china)

						February 2018- China-owned internet service providers were ordered to block access to VPNs

						[March 31, 2018- VPN ban came into effect](https://www.zdnet.com/article/vpns-can-still-be-used-in-china-despite-march-31-ban/)

						[Fosters a culture of self censorship](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs181/projects/2010-11/FreedomOfInformationChina/the-great-firewall-of-china-background/index.html)

						Uses Amazon Web Services, which encrypts all its Web pages so that Chinese censors can't pick which pages to block
