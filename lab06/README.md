In this lab you be installing and configuring DNS servers and clients.

The in-class handout has all the details for the lab, except for setting up your virtual computer.
Take a photo of each Lab Exercise and create a simple lab report showing yorur lab set ups.
The primary report will be the in-class handout.

## Virtual Computer

For this lab you will be using VirtualBox in the STEM lab (our classroom) to complete the lab.
Since everyone will be installing DNS, you will need your own virtual computer to make the configuration changes.

You may use Windows Server 2012 or Ubuntu.
The lab handout gives details instructions for Windows, but you make do similar tasks in Linux if you want.

Relevent ISOs images are available under __/wwu/isos/__ in the lab.
