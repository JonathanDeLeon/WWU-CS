# Raw Sockets
All the programming we have done has been at the transport level. Python provides a raw
socket interface that allows you to fiddle with lower layer headers. Can you learn about the
raw sockets library and show how you can spoof a MAC address at the IP layer? You can
find plenty of information on the web about this.
