# Lab 1
This lab was done by Jonathan De leon and Matthew Ma as part of the *CPTR 210 Data Communications and Networks* lab assignment.

## Background
The lab was focused on familiarizing ourselves with the equipment while creating a small closed network only visible to two laptops and the Linksys router.

## Process
1. Connect the router to power.
2. Connect the two laptops to power. Booted one laptop to Windows and the other to Ubuntu. Disabled Firewall on Windows machine and enabled DHCP in the Network settings.
3. Logged into the machines with the administrator account.	
4. Connect the laptops to the Linksys router via RJ45 Ethernet cables. One was connected with a grey ethernet cable and the other black.
