# Quadratic Formula

This program was built in Python for *CPTR 454 Design & Analysis of Algorithms* at Walla Walla University. It was the programming portion of Homework 10.
The assignment was to write a program to solve the quadratic equation `ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0`

Some things to note:
* Program is intended to only use basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
* Complex numbers are represented as a string in the form `x = a + bj`

To run the program in terminal:
```
$ python quadratic.py
```

Example input/output:
```
Welcome!
